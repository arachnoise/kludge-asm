This project is the kludge assembler, a small assembler I wrote
to improve the coding process for a simple virtual machine called the
kludge machine.

The kludge machine is an educational tool that was used in my computer
science classes when I was in college. It was a way to show students
how different programming paradigms allowed lesser or greater power
over creating abstractions. Specifically, it was a lesson in the pain
of machine language programming.

Installation:
Extract to your home directory and run make. It's as simple as that. 

It's currently set up for a windows gcc-based build environment and
compilation has been tested for mingw 4.x with no problems.

Usage:
kludgeasm <filename>

See www.mingw.org for help setting up mingw for windows.
